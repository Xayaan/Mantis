// +++ WHAT IS THIS? +++ //
// +++++++++++++++++++++ //

// This state file provides metadata to the ImageDrawer.tsx, which is used in many parts of the app.
// So that users can easily cycle between pages without losing their data, we store multiple "batches"
// of images in the state. Storing batches of random images prevents having to make constant API 
// requests for individual images. Constant requests will make the site needlessly complex and slow.

// As the dataset grows, we will need to look at alternative solutions so that the middleware isn't too
// clogged. Adding garbage collection, limiting images per batch, etc. Concerns for later.
